\section*{Acknowledgements}
Words fail to express my deep gratitude to my parents. Whatever road I would take, they have stood by me and supported me.\\

Admittedly, I'm feeling a little bit like a dwarf standing on giants' shoulders. Thank you, giants, for sharing some of your farsightedness with me!\\

\noindent
Finally, I would like to thank everybody who has been a positive influence in my life.
